Give AI access without giving up control.

Add Proofable to any app, chat, or agent that speaks MCP.

`https://mcp.proofable.me/mcp`

## Install

**[One-click install](https://proofable.me/install)** detects your client and writes the config: Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, or Codex.

Then click **Connect**, sign in, and ask:

```text
Show my Proofable profile and current proofs.
```

### Claude Code

In Claude Code, the repository is also a plugin marketplace:

```text
/plugin marketplace add proofable/mcp
/plugin install proofable-mcp@proofable
```

Use either the plugin or a manual entry, not both. The plugin registers the same endpoint and ships the skills in [`plugins/proofable-mcp`](./plugins/proofable-mcp).

## Connect

Two paths, one endpoint, one profile:

- **Connect (OAuth):** add the hosted server, click **Connect**, sign in in the browser. Best for interactive clients.
- **Server key:** best for servers, CI, and headless agents. Send it as a Bearer token.

Any MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "proofable": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.proofable.me/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Servers and automation:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "proofable": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.proofable.me/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${PROOFABLE_ACCESS_KEY}" }
    }
  }
}
```

Create a key at [Access keys](https://proofable.me/profile?tab=account), then `export PROOFABLE_ACCESS_KEY=npk_...` in that environment.

Or let the installer write the same entry for any tool:

```bash
npx -y @proofable/sdk setup
```

Then ask: "Show my Proofable profile and current proofs."

## What it does

| Job | Tools |
|---|---|
| Load the signed-in profile and workflow | `proofable_context` (call first) |
| Check, reuse, or create proof | `proofable_proofs_check`, `proofable_verify_or_guide`, `proofable_verify`, `proofable_proofs_get`, `proofable_verifiers_catalog` |
| Give agents an owner and permissions | `proofable_agent_link`, `proofable_agent_create`, `proofable_agent_mount` |
| Store secrets without exposing them | `proofable_secret_create`, `proofable_secret_list`, `proofable_secret_revoke` |

## Authentication

Two paths, one session model: interactive clients Connect with OAuth (PKCE, silent refresh); servers and CI send a server key (`npk_...`) as a Bearer token from `PROOFABLE_ACCESS_KEY`. Same endpoint, same Proofable profile, same tools and policy. Never put a key in client config or chat when Connect works. See [Auth](https://docs.proofable.me/mcp/auth).

## This package

`@proofable/mcp` publishes the registry manifest (`server.json`) and the public skills. It does not run a local server. To build an app against Proofable, start from [github.com/proofable/sdk](https://github.com/proofable/sdk).

```js
import { serverManifest } from '@proofable/mcp';
```

The standards server card (`server.json`, `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`) stays OAuth-first.

# Guard an agent action

This example loads the current Proofable runtime mount and makes one permission decision before host code runs a tool.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npx -y -p @proofable/sdk proofable setup
npx -y -p @proofable/sdk proofable mount <agentId> --apply <host>
```

Click **Connect** after setup. `<host>` is the adapter your CLI accepts (`cursor`, `claude`, or `codex`).

## Check an action

```bash
npm start -- read_proofs
npm start -- send_message --irreversible
```

The process exits with code `0` only when the current permission proof allows the action. A denied action, missing permission proof, expired permission, or required human approval exits with code `2`.

The host remains responsible for stopping the tool call when the decision is not `allowed`.

See [Run your first guarded action](https://docs.proofable.me/mcp/guarded-action) for the full flow.
